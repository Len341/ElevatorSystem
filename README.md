# ElevatorSystem

# ElevatorSystem is a C# project that simulates an elevator system with multiple elevators and floors.
# It allows users to request elevators, move them between floors, and view their states.
# The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and design patterns.
# The system includes error handling, logging, and unit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.

# Project Structure
# - `ElevatorSystem/`: Contains the main application code, including models, services and interfaces.
# - `ElevatorSystem/Utils/Logger.cs`: Contains logging utilities for debugging and monitoring.
# - `ElevatorSystem/Utils/ElevatorHelper.cs`: Contains helper methods for elevator operations.
# - `ElevatorSystem/Utils/GeneralHelper.cs`: Contains general utility methods.
